   I wanted to target the male audience by making a manly theme website with a quality lookbook. I used flexbox making the lookbook for ease and responsiveness it gives. I put behind
   the scenes section to give the male clients a good feel of the shop. And all the important details for them to know like our services and how much it costs.

# Optimizations
  I'll add online reservation/booking option for clients who want to have a guaranteed appoinment with the barbers they like for improve user experience, in-store experience and
  potential increase of sales.

# Lesson Learned
   What I learned while working on this was that you dont need to have a complicated website for it to look good and be pleasing for the clients. This also helped me improved
   write good, dry and readable code.
